            Home Assistant is my to go platform for smart home integration. I run Home Assistant 
            on Docker in Raspberry Pi 4. I chose Home Assistant because i am able to integrate 
            smart devices from different brands into one platform. This way, i don't have to open 
            multiple apps if i want to control or get data from sensors of different brand. 
            <br><br>
            Recently i have also added Zigbee coordinator to Home Assistant. This enables me to 
            move zigbee devices previously tied to specific brand platform into Home Assistant. 
            I get almost no device downtime now compared to the previous configuration. 
            <br><br>
            Another advantage of using Home Assistant is that i can expose the devices on Home 
            Assistant to Apple Home platform, a big win for iOS users. I can now also use Siri to 
            control my home devices.
