## Notable Points

+ Used Github (Source Control)
+ Developed with Flutter using Dart
+ Firmware development with C/C++

## Summary

WebSocket Tester is the second app i have developed. This app is sort of a spin-off from my first app, Controller. WebSocket Tester act as a websocket server, and allow users to test their implementation of WebSocket server.

This app will provide the statistics of the websocket connection, which are:

+ Connection status,
+ The time when the server is connected,
+ Delta time of sending and receiving data,

I have also written a firmware for ESP microcontroller to act as a WebSocket server. User can use their ESP device to play with the WebSocket Tester app.
