## Notable Points

+ mDNS
+ Used Github (Source Control)
+ Developed in Flutter using Dart

## Summary

mDNS Discovery is an app capable of discovering any available services in the local network such as,

+ samba (smb)
+ printer
+ ssh
+ and any other.

Any succesfully resolved mDNS search will return the hostname, IP address, port, service type, and attributes of the service. This search is particularly useful when user would like to find the IP address of the specific device. Developer would also find this app useful for testing the implementation of mDNS on their device.

There are 2 modes in this app, specific search, and general search. Specific search will look for a specific mDNS services that is supplied before the start of the search. General search, on the other hand, will look into all available services in the network.
